Fetch and analyze Missouri public school enrollment data from the
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).

## What can you find with moschooldata?

**20 years of enrollment data (2006-2025).** 870,000 students. 550+
districts. Here are ten stories hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. St. Louis City: A district in crisis

St. Louis Public Schools has lost over 50% of its enrollment since 2000,
now serving under 20,000 students.

``` r
library(moschooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(c(2006, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025))

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id == "115115",
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students)
```

### 2. Kansas City 33 isn’t much better

KCPS has lost nearly half its students, now enrolling around 14,000.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id == "048078",
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Suburban St. Louis County is fragmenting

With dozens of tiny districts, St. Louis County has the most fragmented
school system in America.

``` r
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

# Count districts under 2,000 students
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  mutate(size = case_when(
    n_students < 500 ~ "Under 500",
    n_students < 1000 ~ "500-999",
    n_students < 2000 ~ "1,000-1,999",
    n_students < 5000 ~ "2,000-4,999",
    TRUE ~ "5,000+"
  )) %>%
  group_by(size) %>%
  summarize(n_districts = n())
```

### 4. Springfield is stable

Missouri’s third-largest city has maintained consistent enrollment
around 25,000 students.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Springfield R-XII", district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Missouri is diversifying slowly

The state has gone from 80% white to about 70% white, with Hispanic
students driving the change.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  select(end_year, subgroup, pct)
```

### 6. COVID crushed kindergarten

Missouri lost over 10,000 kindergartners in 2021, a drop of nearly 14%.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("PK", "K", "01", "06", "12")) %>%
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Charter schools concentrated in cities

Missouri’s charter schools are limited to Kansas City and St. Louis by
law, serving over 30,000 students.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_charter, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  summarize(
    total_charter = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_schools = n()
  )
```

### 8. Columbia grows with the university

Home to Mizzou, Columbia 93 is one of the few mid-Missouri districts
gaining students.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Columbia 93", district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Economic disadvantage is widespread

Over 50% of Missouri students are economically disadvantaged, with rates
exceeding 80% in many rural and urban districts.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "econ_disadv", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students, pct) %>%
  head(10)
```

### 10. The Ozarks are aging out

Rural districts in the Ozarks region have lost 20-30% of students as
young families leave.

``` r
ozarks <- c("Mountain Grove", "West Plains", "Willow Springs", "Cabool")

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl(paste(ozarks, collapse = "|"), district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students)
```
